# Latency Measurement Tool

## Overview

The Latency Measurement Tool is a desktop application built using Python's `tkinter` library. It allows users to measure various network parameters such as latency, port status, DNS lookup, and proxy functionality. The tool provides a user-friendly interface to perform these operations and view the results.

## Features

- **Ping Test**: Measure the latency to a specified URL or IP address.
- **GET Request**: Perform an HTTP GET request to a specified URL and measure the response time.
- **Port Check**: Check if a specific port on a specified URL or IP address is open.
- **NSLookup**: Perform a DNS lookup for a specified URL.
- **Proxy Check**: Verify if an HTTP proxy is functioning correctly for a specified URL.
- **Stop Operation**: Ability to stop ongoing operations.
- **Reset Output**: Clear the output display area.
- **Download Output**: Save the results to a text file.
